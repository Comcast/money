/**
 * Creates KafkaProducerApp instances.
 *
 * We require such a factory because of how Storm and notably
 * [[http://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Serialization.html serialization within Storm]] work.
 * Without such a factory we cannot properly unit tests Storm bolts that need to write to Kafka.
 *
 * Preferably we would simply pass a Kafka producer directly to a Storm bolt.  During testing we could then mock this
 * collaborator.  However this intuitive approach fails at (Storm) runtime because Kafka producers are not serializable.
 * The alternative approach of instantiating the Kafka producer from within the bolt (e.g. using a `@transient lazy val`
 * field) does work at runtime but prevents us from verifying the correct interaction between our bolt's code and its
 * collaborator, the Kafka producer, because we cannot easily mock the producer in this setup.  The chosen approach of
 * the factory method, while introducing some level of unwanted indirection and complexity, is a pragmatic approach to
 * make our Storm code work correctly at runtime and to make it testable.
 *
 * @param topic The Kafka topic to send data to.
 * @param brokerList  Value for Kafka's `metadata.broker.list` setting.
 * @param config Additional producer configuration settings.
